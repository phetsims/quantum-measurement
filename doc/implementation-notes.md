# Quantum Measurement - Implementation Notes

## Terminology

## General Design Elements

### Coins Screen

TODO - Notes made during the implementation of the "Coins" screen. These should eventually be rolled into a cohesive
narrative.

- Term to mention - "test box"
- The main model has two experiment types - physical and quantum.  There is a type called `SystemType` that is used
to parameterize the model and view in quite a number of places.
- Each of these experiments moves back and forth between preparation and measurement, starting in preparation.
- In the docs, note the parallel between flipping the coin in the physical scene and re-preparing it in the quantum 
  scene.
