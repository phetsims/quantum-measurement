/**
 * ParticleWithSpinModel is the model for a particle with a predetermined spin. It has a lifetime, which will
 * determine its position in the Ray Path, and a spin value, which will be modified as it passes through the SG apparatuses.
 *
 *
 * // TODO: Would this be better off as an enumeration or state machine??? https://github.com/phetsims/quantum-measurement/issues/53
 * The lifetime should determine the current position of the particle in the view, like so:
 * t = 0 to t = 1: Traveling from source to SG1
 * t = 1 to t = 2: Being measured inside SG1
 * t = 2 to t = 3: Traveling from SG1 to SG2 or SG3 (if applicable)
 * t = 3 to t = 4: Being measured inside SG2 or SG3 (if applicable)
 * t = 4 to t = 5: Traveling onwards from SG2 or SG3
 * ( For experiments with only SG1, t = 2 to t = 5 is just traveling along the Ray Path )
 *
 * This time is not measured in seconds, but rather, scaled to the different moments in the life of the particle.
